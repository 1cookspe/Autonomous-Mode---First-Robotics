# Autonomous-Mode---First-Robotics

The code behind the autonomous mode of Garth Webb Secondary School's robot in the 2015 First Robotics Competition. The robot was given fifteen seconds to perform without the input or control of the drivers, relying on the autonomous mode to move around the arena and collect points. All members of the programming team worked together as a unit to write an effective and productive algorithm to power the robot.
